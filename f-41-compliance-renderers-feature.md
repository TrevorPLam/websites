# f-41-compliance-renderers-feature

## Summary
Implement the compliance renderers feature in the compliance package to handle rendering of compliance-related content according to regulatory requirements.

## Description
The compliance package contains scaffolded renderer components that need to be fully implemented. These renderers are responsible for displaying compliance information in a way that meets regulatory standards and requirements. The implementation should ensure that all compliance-related content is rendered properly and adheres to the necessary guidelines.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All compliance renderer components are fully implemented
- Renderers properly display compliance information according to regulatory standards
- Proper handling of compliance metadata and disclosures
- Responsive design for compliance content across different devices
- Accessibility compliance for all rendered content
- Proper internationalization support for compliance text
- Error handling for missing or invalid compliance data
- Unit tests covering all renderer functionality
- Integration tests validating proper rendering in different contexts

## Implementation Notes
- Follow regulatory guidelines for financial services compliance
- Implement proper disclosure rendering mechanisms
- Ensure all compliance content is properly attributed and dated
- Consider performance implications of rendering large compliance documents
- Handle edge cases where compliance information might be incomplete
