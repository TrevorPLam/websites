          # SLSA Level 3 Provenance Summary

          This workflow prepares release artifacts to be published with trusted provenance.

          ## Controls implemented

          - Hosted ephemeral CI runner with immutable workflow definition.
          - OIDC-enabled identity token permissions (`id-token: write`).
          - Deterministic install using `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.
          - Signed build artifacts for downstream verification.
