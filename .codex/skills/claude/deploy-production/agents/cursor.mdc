# Production Deployment Workflow

Use MCP tools for secure deployment:

1. **Pre-Deployment Validation**: @github-mcp get-repo-status
2. **Security Assessment**: @enterprise-security security-scan
3. **Observability Baseline**: @observability capture-baseline
4. **Deployment Execution**: @secure-deployment deploy-production
5. **Post-Deployment Verification**: @observability health-check

## Prerequisites
- All tests passing in CI/CD
- GitHub status checks green
- Security scan completed
- Deployment window approved

## Error Handling
- Automatic rollback on health check failures
- Alerting via configured channels
- Audit logging with correlation IDs

## Success Criteria
- All services healthy
- Performance metrics within acceptable ranges
- No security vulnerabilities introduced
- User-facing functionality verified
