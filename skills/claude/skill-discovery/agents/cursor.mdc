# Skill Discovery

Use MCP tools for comprehensive skill discovery:

1. **Skills Catalog**: @filesystem read-directory (.claude/skills/)
2. **MCP Server Inventory**: @skillset list-mcp-servers
3. **Capability Search**: @skillset search-capabilities
4. **Skill Recommendations**: @skillset recommend-skills

## Search Categories

### Development Workflows
- Code Review: Security analysis, quality checks, architecture review
- Deployment: Production deployment, Azure deployment, infrastructure provisioning
- Testing: Unit tests, integration tests, E2E testing
- Multi-Tenant: Tenant setup, billing, rate limiting

### Infrastructure & Operations
- Database: SQLite access, query optimization, migrations
- Security: Vulnerability scanning, compliance checks, audit logging
- Monitoring: Performance metrics, health checks, observability
- Authentication: OAuth 2.1, SAML 2.0, tenant isolation

### External Integrations
- Version Control: GitHub operations, repository management
- Documentation: Web fetching, API documentation
- Communication: Slack notifications, team coordination
- Project Management: Linear/Jira integration, ticket management

## Usage Patterns

### Explicit Discovery
