# Automated Code Review Scripts - Semantic Chunk Index

## Overview
This document has been semantically chunked for optimal AI retrieval. The original file exceeded 1200 tokens and has been split into 4 logical chunks.

## Chunks

### Chunk 1: automated-review-scripts-chunk-1.md

- **Tokens**: 950
- **File**: [automated-review-scripts-chunk-1.md](automated-review-scripts-chunk-1.md)
- **Focus**: Security Review Scripts - Comprehensive security vulnerability scanning with hardcoded secrets detection, SQL injection prevention, XSS vulnerability checking, and tenant isolation compliance

### Chunk 2: automated-review-scripts-chunk-2.md

- **Tokens**: 980
- **File**: [automated-review-scripts-chunk-2.md](automated-review-scripts-chunk-2.md)
- **Focus**: Performance Review Scripts - Bundle size analysis, optimization recommendations, duplicate module detection, and performance scoring

### Chunk 3: automated-review-scripts-chunk-3.md

- **Tokens**: 990
- **File**: [automated-review-scripts-chunk-3.md](automated-review-scripts-chunk-3.md)
- **Focus**: Architecture Review Scripts - FSD compliance checking, import rule validation, circular dependency detection, and architectural pattern enforcement

### Chunk 4: automated-review-scripts-chunk-4.md

- **Tokens**: 920
- **File**: [automated-review-scripts-chunk-4.md](automated-review-scripts-chunk-4.md)
- **Focus**: Quality Review Scripts - Test coverage analysis, quality metrics calculation, CI/CD integration, and comprehensive reporting

## Navigation
- Start with [Chunk 1](automated-review-scripts-chunk-1.md) for security review scripts
- Each chunk is designed to be semantically complete
- Use this index to navigate to specific sections

## AI Retrieval Tips
- Each chunk is optimized for 800-1200 token context windows
- Chunks maintain semantic coherence and context
- Use specific chunk files for targeted information retrieval
- All chunks include complete TypeScript implementations
- Each chunk contains CLI interfaces and usage examples

## Complete Workflow
The complete automated review system includes:
1. **Security Scanning**: Vulnerability detection and tenant isolation
2. **Performance Analysis**: Bundle optimization and metrics
3. **Architecture Validation**: FSD compliance and import rules
4. **Quality Assurance**: Test coverage and quality scoring

## Integration Ready
All scripts are production-ready with:
- Complete TypeScript implementations
- CLI interfaces with proper argument parsing
- Error handling and validation
- Report generation in multiple formats
- CI/CD integration examples
