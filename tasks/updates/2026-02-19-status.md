# 2026-02-19 Status Update

## Done today
- Turbo Windows block resolved via Defender allow-list; Turbo commands working.
- Fixed infra theme typings (tokens/css-vars/extension) so @repo/infrastructure-theme type-checks pass.
- ScriptManager now takes a Script component prop (no Next.js import) and cleans types.
- Marketing components placeholders expanded (Hero/CTA/Services/Testimonials/Pricing + index exports) to satisfy section adapters; added jest-dom and react-window ambient types.
- Integrations-core fixes: circuit breaker options corrected, DLQ returns null, captureStackTrace guarded, tsconfig path fixed. Integrations analytics/hubspot tsconfig now extend shared base.

## Outstanding / Next
- Re-run `pnpm type-check` to confirm marketing-components and integrations (hubspot/analytics/supabase) are clean after path fixes.
- Hubspot/Supabase may still need DOM guards (window/crypto) if errors persist on next type-check.

## Files touched (non-exhaustive)
- package.json scripts (Turbo workarounds still present)
- packages/infra/index.ts export path fixed
- packages/infrastructure/theme (tokens/css-vars/extension) typings
- packages/ui/components/ScriptManager.tsx (prop-based Script, cleaner types)
- packages/marketing-components components/types/index + ambient d.ts
- packages/integrations-core (client/dlq/errors/tsconfig)
- packages/integrations-(analytics|hubspot) tsconfig extends shared base
- scripts/turbo-workaround.js, scripts/type-check-all.js (workarounds)
