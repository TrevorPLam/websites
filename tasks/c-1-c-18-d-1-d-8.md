## Part 5: Reference

### Code Patterns

**Component Pattern (Radix + CVA):** Import from `radix-ui` (unified package). Use `cva` for variants. `cn` from @repo/utils. `forwardRef` pattern. See `packages/ui/src/components/Dialog.tsx`, `Button.tsx`.

**Metaheader Template:** File path, TRACE, Purpose, Exports, Used by, Invariants, Status, Features tags.

**Package.json Template:** name `@repo/<pkg>`, workspace deps, peer react/react-dom catalog:, exports, scripts lint/type-check.

**Feature Package Structure:** `index.ts` exports Form, schema, actions, providers. Schema in lib/schema, actions in lib/actions.

### File Reference Guide

| Area           | Files                                                                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| UI Components  | `packages/ui/src/components/Button.tsx`, `Input.tsx`, `Accordion.tsx`, `Dialog.tsx`               |
| Configuration  | `packages/types/src/site-config.ts`, `templates/hair-salon/site.config.ts`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml` |
| Features       | `packages/features/src/` (booking, contact, blog, services, search)                               |
| Env Validation | `packages/infra/env/schemas/` (7 Zod schemas)                                                     |
| Security       | `packages/infra/security/csp.ts`                                                                  |
| Package Setup  | `packages/ui/package.json`, `packages/infra/package.json`                                         |

### Radix UI (Unified Package)

Use `radix-ui` (unified). Import: `import { Dialog, Tabs, Popover } from 'radix-ui'`. Sonner for Toast (separate). No @radix-ui/react-\* individual packages.

### Scripted Execution (Planned)

```bash
pnpm program:wave0   # repo integrity
pnpm program:wave1   # feature extraction + parity
pnpm program:wave2   # template assembly
pnpm program:wave3   # starter/client verification
pnpm health          # lint + type-check + build + test
pnpm validate-client [path]  # config + routes + build smoke
```

### Quick Commands

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @repo/ui add <pkg>
pnpm -r run build
pnpm --filter "...[origin/main]" run build
pnpm turbo lint type-check test build
```

### Program Cadence

- **Daily:** WIP limit 1 in-progress per lane
- **Twice weekly:** Unblock + dependency review
- **Weekly:** Ship from completed NOW only; defer NEXT/LATER unless blocking

### Success Criteria (End of Week 12)

- No templates directory
- At least 5 example clients
- All features in packages/features/
- 20+ components (14 UI + 10 marketing + variants)
- Configuration-driven (site.config.ts only)
- Documentation complete
- pnpm build && pnpm test green
- CWV: LCP < 2.5s, INP < 200ms, CLS < 0.1

### Missing Research & Analysis Gaps

- Comprehensive API Documentation
- Migration Playbooks
- Performance Benchmarking Suite (Lighthouse CI)
- Security Hardening Guide
- Multi-tenant Architecture Patterns
- Edge Computing Implementation Guide
- i18n Strategy
- Bundle Size Analysis
- Dependency Security Audit
- Local Development Environment (Docker)
- A/B Testing Framework
- Monitoring & Alerting
- Competitive Analysis
- _(Full list retained from TODO.md — 80+ items across Documentation, Technical Debt, Developer Experience, Business Features, Infrastructure, Innovation)_

## Part 6: Strategic Enhancements & Future Roadmap

**Date:** February 18, 2026  
**Purpose:** Research-backed enhancements to evolve the platform from feature-rich to industry-defining. Five pillars: Intelligent Content & Discovery, Privacy & Sustainability, DevEx as Product, Real-Time Adaptation, Future-Proof Architecture.

### Executive Summary

Platform foundation is robust: layered architecture, CaCA, React 19, RSC-first, comprehensive governance. Enhancements focus on:

1. **Intelligent Content & Discovery** — AEO, digital twins, intent marketplaces
2. **Privacy & Sustainability as Competitive Advantages** — consent lifecycle, W3C WSG
3. **Developer Experience (DevEx) as Product** — platform intelligence, golden paths ROI
4. **Real-Time Adaptation & Feedback Loops** — edge personalization, signal-based optimization
5. **Future-Proof Architecture** — everything-as-code, Feature-Sliced Design, Git-based CMS

Each enhancement maps to existing tasks with concrete steps, file paths, and integration points.

### 6.1 Intelligent Content & Discovery: AEO & Zero-Click Era

Shift from SEO to Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) and Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). Platform must become the definitive source of answers for AI agents.
