# 📋 The Ultimate Guide to Task Documentation

A well-documented task is the foundation of efficient development—whether you're handing it off to a human teammate or an AI agent like Cursor. This guide outlines the essential information every task should include, with practical examples and a ready-to-use template.

## Why Thorough Task Documentation Matters

- **Clarity** – Reduces ambiguity and back-and-forth questions.
- **Efficiency** – Allows immediate execution without context switching.
- **Quality** – Ensures requirements are met and edge cases are handled.
- **AI‑Readiness** – Provides the structured context that AI agents need to generate accurate, project‑appropriate code.

## Core Components of a Well-Documented Task

### 0. Task Metadata

Capture the at-a-glance details up front so tasks plug directly into your tracker, automations, and reporting.

**Include:**

- Task ID / slug (match Linear/Jira/GitHub issue number)
- Owner or responsible pairing partner
- Priority & severity (P0/P1, blocker, etc.)
- Target release or due date
- Related epics, OKRs, or ADR IDs
- Reviewers / stakeholders who must approve

**Example:**

```markdown
## Metadata

- **Task ID**: TASK-204
- **Owner**: @alex-lee
- **Priority**: P1 (impacts upcoming launch)
- **Target Release**: 2026-03-15
- **Related**: Growth Epic GRW-12, ADR-0004 (Booking Conflicts)
- **Reviewers**: @ux-sam, @qa-taylor
```

### 1. Context & Purpose

Explain the **why** behind the task. This helps the implementer make informed decisions and prioritize correctly.

**Include:**

- The business problem or user need being addressed.
- Links to related epics, user stories, or feature requests.
- Any relevant product metrics or success criteria.

**Example:**

```markdown
## Context

Customers frequently abandon the booking process when they encounter double‑booked time slots. This task adds real‑time conflict detection to prevent scheduling overlaps, directly addressing a top user complaint and aiming to reduce booking abandonment by 15%.
```

### 2. Dependencies

List everything the task relies on—both technical and organizational.

**Dependency Types:**

| Type               | Description                                       | Example                                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Package**        | External libraries or internal packages           | `@repo/ui@2.1.0` – provides the `Button` component         |
| **API / Service**  | External endpoints, databases, or cloud services  | HubSpot API – requires API key with `contacts:write` scope |
| **Code Module**    | Specific functions, classes, or files             | `validateBookingTime` from `@repo/features/booking`        |
| **Infrastructure** | Environment variables, feature flags, permissions | `BOOKING_CONFLICT_CHECK` feature flag must be enabled      |
| **Team / Review**  | Required approvals or input                       | UX sign‑off on error message copy                          |

For each dependency, note whether it is **required** or **optional**, and include the **reason** it is needed. This helps with troubleshooting and future maintenance.

### 3. Related Files & File Paths

Explicitly identify every file that will be created, modified, or deleted.

**Best Practice:**

- Use full paths relative to the project root (e.g., `packages/features/booking/validation.ts`).
- Briefly state the purpose of each file in the context of this task.

**Example:**

```markdown
## Related Files

- `templates/hair-salon/components/BookingForm.tsx` – modify to display conflict errors
- `packages/features/booking/validation.ts` – create new `validateBookingTime` function
- `packages/types/booking.ts` – update `Booking` interface with conflict metadata
- `clients/alpha/site.config.ts` – add `booking.preventConflicts` boolean setting
```

### 4. Code Snippets & Examples

Provide concrete examples that illustrate expected behavior, input/output formats, or implementation patterns. This is especially critical for AI agents.

**Include:**

- **Before/after** code for modifications.
- **Usage examples** for new functions or components.
- **Error scenarios** and how they should be handled.
- **Data structures** (e.g., JSON payloads, TypeScript interfaces).

**Example:**

```typescript
// New validation function signature
function validateBookingTime(
  time: Date,
  existingBookings: Booking[],
  businessHours: BusinessHours
): ValidationResult;

// Expected output format
type ValidationResult = {
  valid: boolean;
  error?: {
    code: 'double_booking' | 'outside_hours';
    message: string;
  };
};

// Usage in component
const { valid, error } = validateBookingTime(selectedTime, bookings, config.hours);
if (!valid) {
  setError(error.message);
}
```

### 5. Acceptance Criteria

Define the conditions that must be met for the task to be considered complete. Each criterion should be **testable** and **unambiguous**.

**Good criteria:**

- “Form submission is blocked when the selected time is already booked.”
- “User sees the error message 'This time is unavailable' within 500ms.”
- “The `validateBookingTime` function returns `{ valid: false, error: { code: 'double_booking' } }` for conflicting slots.”

**Avoid vague statements like** “Make sure it works well.”

### 6. Technical Constraints & Considerations

Document any non‑functional requirements that could affect implementation.

**Areas to cover:**

- **Performance** – e.g., “API response must be under 200ms.”
- **Security** – e.g., “All user input must be sanitized to prevent XSS.”
- **Accessibility** – e.g., “Form error messages must be announced by screen readers (WCAG 2.2 AA).”
- **Browser/device support** – e.g., “Must work on iOS Safari 14+.”
- **Compliance** – e.g., “No tracking cookies without explicit consent.”

**Example:**

```markdown
## Technical Constraints

- The booking form must function without JavaScript (progressive enhancement).
- All timestamps must be stored in UTC and converted to the user’s local time zone on the client.
- Error messages must support internationalization (i18n) via `next-intl`.
```

### 7. Implementation Plan (Optional but Recommended)

For complex tasks, a step‑by‑step plan helps break the work into manageable chunks and can be used as a checklist.

**Example:**

```markdown
## Implementation Plan

1. **Data Layer**
   - [ ] Add `bookings.conflict_check` column to the database.
   - [ ] Create repository method `findConflictingBookings(time, resourceId)`.
2. **Validation Logic**
   - [ ] Implement `validateBookingTime` with business hours logic.
   - [ ] Write unit tests for all edge cases.
3. **UI Integration**
   - [ ] Modify `BookingForm` to call validation before submission.
   - [ ] Display error message with appropriate styling.
4. **Configuration**
   - [ ] Add `booking.preventConflicts` to site config schema.
   - [ ] Update client configs to enable feature.
```

### 8. Testing Requirements

Specify what tests should be written and what scenarios they must cover.

**Include:**

- **Unit tests** – functions, components in isolation.
- **Integration tests** – user flows across multiple modules.
- **Manual test cases** – for edge cases that are hard to automate.
- **Performance/load tests** – if applicable.

**Example:**

```markdown
## Testing Requirements

- **Unit tests** (≥80% coverage for new code):
  - Valid time with no conflicts → returns `{ valid: true }`
  - Valid time with conflict → returns `{ valid: false, error.code: 'double_booking' }`
  - Time outside business hours → returns `{ valid: false, error.code: 'outside_hours' }`
  - Invalid input (e.g., `null`) → throws appropriate error
- **Integration tests**:
  - Full booking flow with conflict prevention (using Playwright)
- **Manual tests**:
  - Concurrent booking attempts from two browsers
  - Daylight saving time boundary (March 10, 2026)
```

### 9. Documentation Updates

Identify any existing documentation that needs to be updated as part of the task.

**Common targets:**

- README files
- API reference docs
- Storybook / component examples
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Changelog

**Example:**

```markdown
## Documentation Updates

- [ ] Update `docs/features/booking.md` with conflict prevention details.
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to `validateBookingTime`.
- [ ] Update API examples in `docs/api/booking.md`.
- [ ] Note the change in `CHANGELOG.md` under “Added”.
```

### 10. Design References & Assets

If the task involves UI changes, link to mockups, wireframes, or design tokens.

**Example:**

```markdown
## Design References

- [Figma mockup](https://figma.com/file/...) – shows error state styling.
- [Design tokens](packages/ui/tokens/colors.json) – use `color-feedback-error` for error messages.
```

### 11. Cross-Task Dependencies & Sequencing

Explicitly note how this work fits into the broader program so multiple contributors (human or AI) can execute in parallel without stepping on each other.

**Include:**

- Upstream tasks that must finish first, with links (e.g., `@tasks/2-18-build-portfolio-components.md`).
- Downstream tasks that depend on this work (list expected hand-offs).
- Shared migrations or feature flags that multiple tasks touch.
- Coordination notes (e.g., "Run concurrently with TASK-210 but merge after their schema change").

### 12. Accessibility & Performance Guardrails

Tie every UI or feature change back to the repo’s concrete standards so no requirement is left implicit.

- Reference `docs/accessibility/component-a11y-rubric.md` for WCAG 2.2 AA expectations (focus styles, touch targets, screen-reader copy).
- Link to performance budgets (e.g., `docs/architecture/README.md` or feature-specific specs) and restate target metrics (LCP < 2.5s, INP ≤ 200ms, bundle caps, etc.).
- Call out required testing tools: axe-core, Lighthouse CI, WebPageTest scripts, etc.
- Specify progressive enhancement or streaming requirements when applicable.

### 13. Research & Source of Truth

Maintain a dated research log so future contributors understand _why_ standards exist and can validate them against current industry guidance.

- Use ISO dates (`2026-02-17`) for every entry.
- Summarize the key takeaway in one sentence, then provide a short bullet list of actionable implications for this task.
- Reference repo-aligned sources whenever possible (e.g., `RESEARCH.md`, `docs/architecture/dependency-graph.md`, ADRs, workflow specs).
- Capture _basics, fundamentals, best practices, highest standards, and novel techniques_ relevant to the task scope (UI, performance, integrations, etc.).
- Flag when research sunsets (e.g., "Review again after 2026-06-01 release") so stale info can be rotated out.

**Example:**

```markdown
## Research (Updated 2026-02-17)

- **Source**: docs/accessibility/component-a11y-rubric.md, WCAG 2.2
  - Touch targets min 24×24 CSS px; confirm alert buttons honor this.
- **Source**: RESEARCH.md §"Edge-Native Delivery"
  - Booking flow must keep JS payload < 250KB gzipped; plan extra code-splitting.
- **Source**: ADR-0004 Booking Conflicts
  - Reuse `BookingConflictService`; avoid duplicating heuristic logic.
```

## 🎯 Best Practices Summary

| Practice | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| **Write for your future self** | You'll forget details; explicit docs save time. |
| **Use concrete examples** | Abstract requirements are often misinterpreted. |
| **Link everything** | Make it easy to navigate to related issues, designs, and files. |
| **Keep tasks atomic** | One task should do one thing; avoid scope creep. |
| **Include error paths** | Edge cases are where bugs hide. |
| **Specify “why” not just “what”** | Enables better decision‑making during implementation. |
| **Make criteria testable** | “Works well” is not testable; “returns 200 OK” is. |

## 💡 Pro Tips for Cursor AI & Monorepos

Since you're using Cursor and managing a monorepo, consider these extra steps:

- **Use `@` mentions** in your task descriptions to point Cursor to relevant files (e.g., `@packages/features/booking/validation.ts`).
- **Provide schema examples** for data structures you expect the AI to generate.
- **Reference your `.cursorrules`** or project‑specific coding guidelines to ensure consistency.
- **Include environment variable names** and their expected values if configuration is required.
- **For client‑specific tasks**, note which `site.config.ts` fields should be modified.

## ✅ Quality Checklist & Repo Standards

Before marking a task as complete, verify that:

- [ ] Metadata, context, and dependency sections are filled out (omit sections only when truly N/A).
- [ ] Cross-task sequencing is documented so collaborators know order of operations.
- [ ] Accessibility requirements reference `docs/accessibility/component-a11y-rubric.md` and include concrete success criteria (focus, contrast, touch targets, announcements).
- [ ] Performance targets (LCP/INP/CLS, bundle size, streaming requirements) are documented with links to monitoring dashboards or specs.
- [ ] Every file path is correct, clickable, and scoped to the repo root for Cursor `@` mentions.
- [ ] Code examples compile/run when pasted (cursor-friendly snippets, TypeScript types, data contracts).
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are testable and map to automation or manual checks.
- [ ] Dependencies include version constraints + feature flags/env vars with their storage location.
- [ ] Testing instructions cover unit/integration/e2e, and specify required commands (e.g., `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test:e2e`).
- [ ] Accessibility/performance tooling is listed (e.g., axe, Lighthouse CI, WebPageTest).
- [ ] Documentation updates list exact files (e.g., `docs/features/booking.md`, ADRs, changelog).
- [ ] Research section contains up-to-date, date-stamped sources tied to repo docs/ADRs and highlights basics → novel techniques relevant to the task.
