# F.29 Deployment System

**Status:** [ ] TODO | **Batch:** Infrastructure | **Effort:** 16h | **Deps:** F.28

**Related Research:** Deployment patterns, CI/CD, deployment platforms

**Objective:** Deployment system with CI/CD integration and deployment utilities.

**Files:** `packages/infrastructure/deployment/` (index, ci-cd.ts, platforms.ts, utils.ts, config.ts)

**API:** `deploy`, `DeploymentConfig`, `CICDProvider`, `DeploymentUtils`, `useDeployment`

**Checklist:** CI/CD integration; platforms; utilities; config; export.
**Done:** Builds; deployment system functional; CI/CD works; platforms work.
**Anti:** No custom deployment engine; standard CI/CD only.
