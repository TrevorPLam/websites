## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Customization hooks; style overrides; theme extensions; config overrides; export.
- [ ] Builds
- [ ] customization hooks functional
- [ ] runtime customization works.

## Technical Constraints

- No custom hook engine
- standard React hooks only.

## Accessibility & Performance Requirements

- Accessibility: Reference [docs/accessibility/component-a11y-rubric.md](docs/accessibility/component-a11y-rubric.md) for UI tasks; (N/A for non-UI)
- Performance: (Add target metrics: LCP, INP, bundle size per task scope)

## Implementation Plan

- [ ] Customization hooks; style overrides; theme extensions; config overrides; export.

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for new code
- Integration tests where applicable
- Run `pnpm test`, `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm lint` to verify

## Documentation Updates

- [ ] Update relevant docs (add specific paths per task)
- [ ] Add JSDoc for new exports

## Design References

- (Add links to mockups or design assets if applicable)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Build passes
