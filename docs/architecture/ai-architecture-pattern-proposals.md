# AI Architecture Pattern Proposals

Use AI-generated proposals as draft architecture options, never as auto-approved designs.

## Required proposal sections

- Context and constraints
- Candidate patterns (minimum 3)
- Security implications
- Tenant isolation impact
- Trade-offs and rollback plan

## Process

1. Start from `prompts/architecture-patterns.prompt.md`.
2. Save proposal artifacts under `docs/architecture/proposals/`.
3. Review in ADR workflow before implementation.
