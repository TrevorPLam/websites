# Architecture (Explanation)

The primary architecture documentation lives in the topic-based docs structure:

- **[Architecture Overview](../../architecture/README.md)** — System design, layer model, repository structure, security, performance, deployment
- [Module Boundaries](../../architecture/module-boundaries.md)
- [Dependency Graph](../../architecture/dependency-graph.md)

This page redirects to the main [Architecture Overview](../../architecture/README.md).
