# Living Documentation Policy

## Policy

Documentation is a required deliverable, not optional follow-up work.

## Contributor checklist

- Update docs in the same PR as behavior changes.
- Include impacted docs in PR description.
- Run docs quality checks before requesting review.

## Review cadence

- Quarterly docs review in first week of each quarter.
- Domain owners review stale pages (>180 days without update).

## Enforcement

- CI runs docs quality and docs site build for markdown/doc changes.
- PRs are blocked when required docs updates are missing.

## Task mapping

- DOMAIN-37-2-5 commit-to-living-documentation
