# Domain 37 Part 8 — Research and Delivery Simplification

## Parent task objective

Simplify discovery-to-delivery workflows so research and early-stage delivery artifacts remain decision-oriented, auditable, and low-overhead.

## Implemented tasks

- DOMAIN-37-098-research-complexity-reduction — standardized research into one brief and one decision note.
- DOMAIN-37-099-experimentation-simplification — reduced experimentation to hypothesis, measurable threshold, and outcome summary.
- DOMAIN-37-100-proof-of-concept-cleanup — constrained POCs to highest-risk assumptions with disposable boundaries.
- DOMAIN-37-101-prototype-simplification — prioritized low-fidelity, critical-flow prototypes with consolidated feedback logging.
- DOMAIN-37-102-mvp-development-cleanup — codified thin-slice MVP scope with deferred enhancements and launch-readiness gates.
