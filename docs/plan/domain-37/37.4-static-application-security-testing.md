# Domain 37 Part 4 — Static Application Security Testing

## Parent task objective

Operationalize SAST from local development through CI with clear prioritization and triage ownership.

## Implemented tasks

- DOMAIN-37-4-3 run SAST in IDE plugins via repository extension recommendations and setup guidance.
- DOMAIN-37-4-5 schedule nightly full SAST scans in CI.
- DOMAIN-37-4-6 establish severity matrix for findings.
- DOMAIN-37-4-7 triage findings with owners and ticket tracking conventions.
- DOMAIN-37-4-8 evaluate AI-augmented SAST tools with criteria and adoption decision record.
- DOMAIN-37-4-9 implement AI code security assistant operating guidance for remediation workflows.
- DOMAIN-37-4-10 establish AI code review policy for security-sensitive changes.
- DOMAIN-37-4-11 define ASPM consolidation plan for normalized security posture reporting.
- DOMAIN-37-4-12 enable dependency reachability analysis in CI with blocking behavior for reachable high/critical findings.
