# Domain 37 Part 3 — Secure Software Development Lifecycle

## Parent task objective

Define and enforce secure SDLC foundations through documented requirements, standards mapping, threat modeling, and security guardrails in local and CI workflows.

## Implemented tasks

- DOMAIN-37-3-1 document security and privacy requirements.
- DOMAIN-37-3-2 map repository requirements to OWASP, NIST SSDF, and GDPR.
- DOMAIN-37-3-3 perform threat modeling for high-risk feature areas.
- DOMAIN-37-3-4 store threat models in `/docs/security/threat-models`.
- DOMAIN-37-3-5 define annual threat model review policy.
- DOMAIN-37-3-6 adopt secure coding guidelines.
- DOMAIN-37-3-7 integrate security linting (Semgrep + CodeQL in SAST workflow).
- DOMAIN-37-3-8 implement pre-commit security scans.
- DOMAIN-37-3-9 scan for secrets in pre-commit.
- DOMAIN-37-4-1 select SAST tooling for repository workflows (CodeQL + Semgrep).
- DOMAIN-37-4-2 configure SAST rules aligned to OWASP Top 10 risk categories.
- DOMAIN-37-3-10 integrate SAST into CI quality gates.
- DOMAIN-37-3-11 implement software composition analysis (SCA) scanning.
- DOMAIN-37-3-12 add container and IaC scanning with Trivy.
- DOMAIN-37-3-13 schedule DAST scans with OWASP ZAP baseline.
- DOMAIN-37-3-14 configure CI security gates to fail on high-risk findings.
- DOMAIN-37-4-4 run SAST scans on pull requests.

## QA checkpoints for this parent task

1. `pnpm validate-docs` passes after adding threat modeling and policy documents.
2. `node scripts/verify-staged-secrets.js` passes on clean staged changes and fails on obvious secret patterns.
3. Security requirement docs cross-reference standards mapping, secure coding guidance, and threat model artifacts.
4. `.github/workflows/security-sast.yml` runs CodeQL and Semgrep scans on push, PR, and schedule.
5. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` includes blocking `security-gates` checks for Semgrep + dependency audit.
6. `.github/workflows/dependency-integrity.yml` runs OSV SCA and dependency review checks.
7. `.github/workflows/security-container-iac.yml` uploads Trivy SARIF for filesystem/IaC checks.
8. `.github/workflows/security-dast.yml` runs scheduled OWASP ZAP baseline scans.
9. `.husky/pre-commit` executes security checks before lint-staged formatting.
