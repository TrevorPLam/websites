# Domain 37 Part 3 — Secure Software Development Lifecycle

## Parent task objective

Define and enforce secure SDLC foundations through documented requirements, standards mapping, threat modeling, and security guardrails in local and CI workflows.

## Implemented tasks

- DOMAIN-37-3-1 document security and privacy requirements.
- DOMAIN-37-3-2 map repository requirements to OWASP, NIST SSDF, and GDPR.
- DOMAIN-37-3-3 perform threat modeling for high-risk feature areas.
- DOMAIN-37-3-4 store threat models in `/docs/security/threat-models`.
- DOMAIN-37-3-5 define annual threat model review policy.
- DOMAIN-37-3-6 adopt secure coding guidelines.
- DOMAIN-37-3-7 integrate security linting (Semgrep + CodeQL in SAST workflow).
- DOMAIN-37-3-8 implement pre-commit security scans.
- DOMAIN-37-3-9 scan for secrets in pre-commit.
- DOMAIN-37-4-1 select SAST tooling for repository workflows (CodeQL + Semgrep).
- DOMAIN-37-4-2 configure SAST rules aligned to OWASP Top 10 risk categories.

## QA checkpoints for this parent task

1. `pnpm validate-docs` passes after adding threat modeling and policy documents.
2. `node scripts/verify-staged-secrets.js` passes on clean staged changes and fails on obvious secret patterns.
3. Security requirement docs cross-reference standards mapping, secure coding guidance, and threat model artifacts.
4. `.github/workflows/security-sast.yml` runs CodeQL and Semgrep scans on push, PR, and schedule.
5. `.husky/pre-commit` executes security checks before lint-staged formatting.
