## Parent task objective

Define and enforce secure SDLC foundations through documented requirements, standards mapping, and secure coding guardrails.

## Implemented tasks

- DOMAIN-37-3-1 document security and privacy requirements.
- DOMAIN-37-3-2 map repository requirements to OWASP, NIST SSDF, and GDPR.
- DOMAIN-37-3-6 adopt secure coding guidelines.

## QA checkpoints for this parent task

1. `pnpm validate-docs` passes after introducing security guidance documents.
2. Security requirement documents cross-reference existing policy and workflow artifacts.
3. Standards mapping uses explicit control references for OWASP/NIST/GDPR.
