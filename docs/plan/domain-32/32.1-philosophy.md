### 32.1 Philosophy

**What it is:** Weekly/monthly PDF reports emailed to clients summarizing their lead volume, score distribution, booking count, and source breakdown. Clients feel the platform is working even when they aren't actively logged in. [strapi](https://strapi.io/blog/build-a-pdf-generation-engine-with-nextjs-puppeteer-and-strapi)

**PDF generation choice — `@react-pdf/renderer` over Puppeteer:** Puppeteer requires a headless Chromium binary (~300MB), is slow to launch (~2–5s cold), and fails on Vercel's 250MB function size limit. `@react-pdf/renderer` runs in pure Node.js, generates PDFs in ~100–300ms, requires zero binary dependencies, and runs as a QStash job on any serverless platform.

**Report delivery:** QStash triggers the `report.generate` job weekly (Sunday 11 PM CST) per tenant. The job generates the PDF, uploads it to Supabase Storage, and emails the download link via Resend. The PDF URL is time-limited (signed URL, 7-day expiry).
