# 24.1 Philosophy

**What it is:** When a new lead submits the contact form, the client's portal dashboard updates in real-time — new lead card appears at the top of the feed, score badge glows, notification plays. This is built on Supabase Realtime Postgres Changes. [supabase](https://supabase.com/features/realtime-postgres-changes)

**Security model — RLS on Realtime:** Supabase applies Row Level Security policies to Realtime change streams. The client must be authenticated with a token that has `tenant_id` in its JWT claims for the RLS policy to allow them to receive only their own leads. Without this, Tenant A could subscribe and receive Tenant B's leads. [supabase](https://supabase.com/blog/realtime-row-level-security-in-postgresql)

**Supabase Realtime filter syntax:** The filter is a server-side predicate applied before broadcast — `tenant_id=eq.{uuid}`. This means only matching rows are sent over the WebSocket — not all rows filtered on the client. This is both more secure and dramatically more bandwidth-efficient.
