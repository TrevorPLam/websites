### 34.1 Philosophy

**What it is:** Enterprise-tier clients (typically agencies using the platform under their own brand) want zero visible trace of the underlying platform. The portal itself should show their logo, their brand colors, their custom domain, and no "Powered by" attribution. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdUqkgBW6cQ)

**What changes per white-label client:**

- Portal domain: `portal.johnsplumbing.com` instead of `portal.agency.com`
- Portal logo + favicon: their branding
- Portal primary color: applied via CSS custom properties
- Email sender: `noreply@johnsplumbing.com`
- Remove all "Powered by Agency" footers and attribution
- Custom error pages (`404`, `500`) with their branding

**What does NOT change:** The underlying codebase, database, or infrastructure. White-labeling is a presentation layer controlled entirely by `site.config` + CSS variables. No code branching required.
