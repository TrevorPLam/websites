### 3.1 Why FSD for This Platform

**What it is:** Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) is an architectural methodology organizing code into layers (app, pages, widgets, features, entities, shared) with unidirectional dependencies. Version 2.1 introduces `@x` notation for cross-slice imports.

**Why it matters for multi-tenant monorepo:**

- AI Agent Navigability: Clear file/folder conventions → agents understand codebase structure instantly
- Tenant Isolation: Per-tenant features don't pollute shared packages
- Scalability: Adding new features doesn't require refactoring entire codebase
- Explicit Dependencies: `@x` notation makes cross-slice imports visible and lintable
- Onboarding: New developers (or AI agents) can understand architecture in <30 minutes

**When to adopt:** P0 (Week 1) — Foundational architecture for entire monorepo.
