### 33.1 Philosophy

**What it is:** Two legally mandatory systems — a cookie consent banner (for analytics/marketing cookies) and a data subject rights flow (right of erasure, right of access per GDPR Article 17). The EDPB coordinated enforcement action that launched in 2025 specifically targeted the right to erasure — regulators are actively checking that SaaS platforms process deletion requests correctly.

**Architecture — the platform is dual controller:**

- The **agency** is the data controller for platform-level data (billing info, account data)
- Each **tenant** is the data controller for their leads/bookings (visitor data they collect)
  This means deletion requests for lead data must be processed by the tenant's system, not the agency's. The platform provides the tooling; legal responsibility sits with the client.
