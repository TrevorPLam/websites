### 20.1 Philosophy

**What it is:** Resend is the email delivery infrastructure. React Email 5 is the template system — JSX components compiled to HTML/text that all major email clients can render. Per-tenant domain isolation is critical: each client's emails must come from their own domain (or subdomain) to protect sending reputation. If client A's spam complaints affected all clients, the shared IP pool would be destroyed. [resend](https://resend.com/blog/new-features-in-2025)

**Multi-tenant email architecture:**

- Agency owns `mail.agency.com` — used for platform notifications (billing, onboarding)
- Each client gets their own sending subdomain: `mail.clientdomain.com` — used for lead notifications, booking reminders
- If a client hasn't verified their domain, emails fall back to `mail.agency.com` with reply-to set to the client's address [resend](https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/domains/introduction)
