# 1.1 Core Philosophy

**What it is:** A monorepo consolidates all client sites, shared packages, infrastructure code, and documentation into a single Git repository with unified dependency management, coordinated task execution, and atomic versioning.

**Why it matters:** For a marketing agency managing 50-1,000 client sites, monorepo architecture provides:

- Single source of truth for all client codebases
- Shared component library ensuring brand consistency
- Atomic updates: security patches deploy to all clients simultaneously
- Simplified onboarding: AI agents have complete context in one repository
- Cost efficiency: single CI/CD pipeline, unified infrastructure

**When to build:** P0 (Week 1) — Foundation for entire platform.
