### 28.1 Philosophy

**What it is:** Sanity v3 is the headless CMS powering the blog/content section of each client's marketing site. Content editors (the agency, or the client via Sanity Studio) publish posts, and the marketing site fetches them via GROQ queries with on-demand ISR via Sanity webhooks. The result: a Google-indexed blog with fresh content, zero build-time latency, and zero manual deployment steps.

**Multi-tenant content isolation:** All tenants share one Sanity project (cost savings), with content isolated by a required `tenantId` field on every document. All GROQ queries include `&& tenantId == $tenantId` — no tenant sees another tenant's posts. Premium plan clients can get a dedicated Sanity project with their own Studio subdomain.
