### 7.1 Philosophy

**What it is:** Multi-tenancy means a single codebase serves multiple isolated clients, each seeing only their own data, branding, and features. This platform uses a **shared database, separate schemas via RLS** model — one Supabase project, tenant isolation via `tenant_id` column + RLS policies (Domain 4 §4.4).

**Three routing strategies compared:**

| Strategy          | Example URL           | When to Use                        | Pros                                                    | Cons                                             |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Subdomain**     | `acme.youragency.com` | Default for all new tenants        | Simple DNS (one wildcard), no path conflicts, clean SEO | Requires wildcard SSL cert, cookie scope issues  |
| **Path-based**    | `youragency.com/acme` | Internal tools, short-term clients | No DNS config, instant setup                            | Shared domain weakens brand, path conflicts      |
| **Custom Domain** | `acmelaw.com`         | Clients with established brands    | Maximum brand ownership, best SEO                       | DNS propagation delays, SSL provisioning latency |

**Decision rule:** Start every new client on subdomain routing. Migrate to custom domain when the client provides DNS access. Path routing is for demos and internal tools only. [kitemetric](https://kitemetric.com/blogs/mastering-subdomain-routing-in-next-js-for-multi-tenant-applications)
