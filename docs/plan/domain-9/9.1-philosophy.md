### 9.1 Philosophy

**What it is:** Every marketing site generates leads — form submissions, phone clicks, booking requests, live chat messages. The attribution system captures first-touch and last-touch UTM data, assigns a score (0–100) to each lead, and routes high-scoring leads to immediate notification.

**Why it matters:** Without attribution, clients cannot tell which marketing spend generates leads. A lead from Google Ads has different ROI than one from organic search. The platform captures full UTM data at session start (first touch) and at form submission (last touch) — enabling both models without a third-party attribution service.

**Lead scoring model:** 100-point scale. Score ≥ 70 = qualified (immediate notification + Zapier/HubSpot push). Score 40–69 = warm (daily digest email). Score < 40 = cold (weekly report).
