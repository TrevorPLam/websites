### 13.1 Philosophy

**What it is:** Observability means knowing what happened in production without reproducing it locally. The stack is: **Sentry** (errors + performance tracing) + **Tinybird** (business analytics) + **Vercel Analytics** (core web vitals) + **OpenTelemetry** (distributed traces). [tinybird](https://www.tinybird.co/docs/classic/publish-data/charts/guides/real-time-dashboard)

**Why all four:** Each covers a different layer.

| Layer              | Tool             | What It Monitors                                        | When to Use |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Runtime errors     | Sentry           | Exceptions, server-side crashes, React error boundaries | Always      |
| Performance traces | Sentry + OTEL    | Slow queries, middleware latency, Server Action timing  | Always      |
| Business metrics   | Tinybird         | Leads/day, CWV p75, A/B test results, funnel            | Always      |
| Web vitals         | Vercel Analytics | LCP, INP, CLS per route                                 | Always      |
| Infrastructure     | Vercel Dashboard | Deployment status, function invocations, edge errors    | Always      |
