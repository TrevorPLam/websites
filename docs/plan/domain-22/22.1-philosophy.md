**What it is:** An AI chat bubble on the client's marketing site that answers visitor questions using the site's content as context (RAG), captures lead info, and optionally routes to the booking calendar. It is the highest-converting feature on any service business site because it handles the micro-moment between "I have a question" and "I'll just call someone else."

**Stack:** Vercel AI SDK 4 (`streamText` + `useChat`) + edge runtime for global latency + Supabase vector store for RAG context injection + tenant-specific system prompt built from `site.config`. [ai-sdk](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-chat)
