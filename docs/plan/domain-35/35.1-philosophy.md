### 35.1 Philosophy

**What it is:** A hardened, automated system that prevents performance regressions from ever reaching production. Every PR runs Lighthouse CI audits, every build enforces bundle size limits, and every production deployment feeds Vercel Speed Insights (RUM) so real-user degradation triggers an alert — not a post-mortem.

**Why a budget, not just monitoring:** Monitoring tells you a regression already reached production. A performance budget makes it impossible to merge one. LCP < 2.5s, INP < 200ms, CLS < 0.1 — these are Google's Good thresholds. A single unreviewed `import` of a 200KB charting library can flip LCP from 1.8s to 3.4s. The budget gate catches this in CI before it ships. [almcorp](https://almcorp.com/blog/core-web-vitals-2026-technical-seo-guide/)

**The two enforcement layers:**

| Layer                       | Tool                                   | When It Runs                          | What It Blocks                              |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Bundle size gate            | `@next/bundle-analyzer` + `size-limit` | On every `next build` in CI           | PRs that grow JS payload beyond budget      |
| Lighthouse performance gate | `@lhci/cli`                            | Post-build against preview deployment | PRs where LCP/INP/CLS drops below threshold |
