### 17.1 Philosophy

**What it is:** When a new client signs up, they must configure their site before it goes live. The onboarding wizard collects identity, branding, contact info, domain, and integrations in a linear multi-step flow. All data is persisted progressively — closing the browser at step 3 and returning resumes from step 3.

**Data persistence strategy:** Each step auto-saves to `onboarding_progress` in Supabase via Server Action on `Next` click. This is safer than holding everything in React state until the final submit — network failure at the last step loses nothing.
