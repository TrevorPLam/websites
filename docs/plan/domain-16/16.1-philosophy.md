### 16.1 Philosophy

**What it is:** The CI/CD pipeline is the gatekeeper between code and production. For a monorepo, the critical technique is **affected-package detection** — only building, testing, and deploying the packages changed by a given commit. Without this, a one-line fix in a shared utility triggers full rebuilds of 10+ applications.

**Why Turborepo remote caching is essential:** Without it, every CI run starts cold. With Vercel Remote Cache, if a teammate built `packages/ui` with identical inputs 10 minutes ago, your CI run gets a cache hit — 0ms to rebuild. At 50 PRs/day, this saves 20+ hours of CI time daily.
