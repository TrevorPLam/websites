### 30.1 Philosophy

**What it is:** Every client can connect their own domain (`johnsplumbing.com`) to replace the default subdomain (`johns-plumbing.agency.com`). The platform handles the full flow: client enters domain → platform adds it to Vercel via API → DNS instructions shown → platform polls verification → marks as active. [vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/multi-tenant/domain-management)

**Vercel for Platforms API:** Vercel exposes a REST API for programmatically adding, removing, and checking domains. In multi-tenant apps, the wildcard domain `*.agency.com` is set at project level. Custom domains like `johnsplumbing.com` are added per-deployment via this API. Vercel auto-provisions the SSL certificate once DNS propagates.

**DNS requirements for clients:** Two records are needed. For an apex domain (`johnsplumbing.com`): an `A` record pointing to `76.76.21.21` (Vercel's IP). For a `www` subdomain: a `CNAME` pointing to `cname.vercel-dns.com`.
