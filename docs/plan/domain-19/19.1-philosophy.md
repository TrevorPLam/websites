### 19.1 Philosophy

**What it is:** Cal.com provides the scheduling infrastructure — event types, availability, Google/Outlook calendar sync, video conferencing. Your platform owns the booking _record_ in Supabase (for CRM sync, lead scoring, and GDPR) and Cal.com owns the actual appointment slot. The integration contract is: **your site sends Cal.com the booking, Cal.com sends your webhook the confirmation.** [blog.elest](https://blog.elest.io/cal-com-api-build-custom-booking-flows-and-integrate-with-your-stack/)

**Cal.com API v1 vs v2:** Cal.com deprecated API v1 on **February 15, 2026**. All integrations must use API v2 (`https://api.cal.com/v2`), which requires an OAuth-based access token (`cal_` prefixed) or a managed user token, not a simple API key.

**Architecture — two modes:**

| Mode                 | Use Case                                                        | How                                       |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Embedded widget**  | Client's website — visitor books directly on the marketing site | Cal.com embed JS loads in a drawer/modal  |
| **Managed bookings** | Agency-managed — client's Cal.com account provisioned via API   | Managed User API + per-tenant event types |
