### 36.1 Philosophy

**What it is:** The authoritative operational playbook for promoting code through environments (dev → staging → production), running database migrations safely, rolling back a bad deployment in under 3 minutes, and seeding a fresh environment from scratch. [vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/full-stack/nextjs)

**Vercel's zero-downtime deployment model:** Vercel deploys to immutable URLs, then atomically re-points the production domain alias. The old deployment stays live and serves existing connections until they complete. No traffic is dropped during promotion. [vercel](https://vercel.com/changelog/stage-and-manually-promote-deployments-to-production)

**Database migrations — the critical constraint:** The Next.js app deployment and the Supabase migration run independently. During the window between "migration applied" and "new code deployed," both old and new code versions are running concurrently against the database. All migrations must therefore be **backward-compatible** — never drop a column or rename one in the same deployment as the code that depends on the change.
