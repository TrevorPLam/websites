### 21.1 Philosophy

**What it is:** Every tenant uploads a logo, favicon, and optionally service images. These are stored in Supabase Storage in per-tenant path-prefixed buckets, served through Supabase's built-in image transformation pipeline, and consumed by `next/image` via a custom loader.

**The custom loader is the core architectural decision.** Without it, Next.js would proxy all images through Vercel's image optimization service — adding latency and cost. With the Supabase loader, images are transformed at the edge closer to the Supabase CDN, with on-the-fly `width`, `quality`, and automatic WebP conversion.
