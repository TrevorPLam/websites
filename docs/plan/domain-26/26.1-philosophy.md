# 26.1 Philosophy

**What it is:** Playwright E2E tests cover the critical user journeys that unit tests cannot — multi-tenant routing, auth-gated portal pages, form submission to lead creation, billing checkout.

**Storage state auth pattern:** Playwright supports saving authenticated session state to a JSON file and reusing it across tests. Auth setup runs once per test suite in a global setup file — not once per test file. This saves 3–10 seconds per test file, which compounds to minutes in CI.

**Test isolation strategy:** Each test that creates data (leads, tenants) uses a dedicated test tenant seeded before the suite runs, cleaned up after. Tests never share mutable state — two parallel test workers cannot corrupt each other's data.
