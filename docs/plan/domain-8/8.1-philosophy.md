### 8.1 Philosophy

**What it is:** SEO in 2026 has two audiences: traditional search crawlers (Googlebot, Bingbot) and AI discovery engines (Perplexity, ChatGPT, Claude). The discipline now splits into classical SEO (structured data, canonical URLs, sitemaps, metadata) and Generative Engine Optimization — GEO — (llms.txt, ai-context.json, citation-optimized prose, knowledge-graph schema).

**Why it matters:** Pages with properly implemented schema are **3× more likely** to appear in Google AI Overviews, and GEO-specific techniques increase AI engine visibility by up to 40% according to Princeton research. For marketing clients, an AI mention in Perplexity or ChatGPT when a prospect searches "best HVAC contractor in Plano" is now worth more than a page-2 Google ranking.

**Domains built here:** `metadata`, `sitemap`, `robots`, `structured data`, `OG images`, `Draft Mode`, `llms.txt`, and `edge A/B testing`.
