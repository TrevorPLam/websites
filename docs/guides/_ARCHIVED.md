# 📚 Legacy Documentation Archive

**Status:** ARCHIVED - Content migrated to unified documentation structure  
**Migration Date:** 2026-02-26  
**New Location:** `docs/explanation/`, `docs/how-to/`, `docs/reference/`, `docs/tutorials/`, and `docs/guides-new/`

---

## 🚫 Important Notice

This directory is **archived** and **frozen**. No new content should be added here.

### Where to Find Content Now

All valuable content from this legacy directory has been migrated to the unified Diátaxis structure:

- **Architecture & Deep Dives** → `docs/explanation/`
- **Task-Oriented Guides** → `docs/how-to/`  
- **API References & Specs** → `docs/reference/`
- **Learning Tutorials** → `docs/tutorials/`
- **Domain-Specific Guides** → `docs/guides-new/`

### Migration Strategy

The migration followed these principles:

1. **Diátaxis Framework Compliance** - Content reorganized by user need (tutorial, how-to, reference, explanation)
2. **Domain Preservation** - All high-value technical content preserved and enhanced
3. **Link Updates** - Internal links updated to point to new locations
4. **Frontmatter Standardization** - All migrated content now uses Zod-validated frontmatter

### What Was Migrated

- ✅ Architecture guides → `docs/explanation/architecture/`
- ✅ Security documentation → `docs/explanation/security/`
- ✅ Multi-tenancy patterns → `docs/explanation/multi-tenant/`
- ✅ Performance guides → `docs/explanation/performance/`
- ✅ Development workflows → `docs/how-to/development/`
- ✅ Deployment guides → `docs/how-to/deployment/`
- ✅ API specifications → `docs/reference/api/`
- ✅ Configuration references → `docs/reference/configuration/`
- ✅ Getting started tutorials → `docs/tutorials/getting-started/`

### Remaining Files

Files in this directory are either:
- Duplicates of content already migrated
- Obsolete or superseded documentation
- Low-value reference material

These files will be removed in a future cleanup after confirming all valuable content is preserved.
