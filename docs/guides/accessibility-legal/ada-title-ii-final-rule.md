# ADA Title II Final Rule on Web Accessibility

## Overview

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) published a final rule under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requiring state and local government websites and mobile applications to meet specific digital accessibility standards. This rule, published on April 24, 2024, establishes WCAG 2.1 Level AA as the technical standard for government digital content.

## Key Requirements

### Technical Standard

- **WCAG 2.1 Level AA**: All state and local government web content and mobile applications must comply with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Version 2.1, Level AA
- **Scope**: Applies to all web content and mobile apps provided by state and local governments, including their departments, agencies, and programs

### Compliance Deadlines

#### Population-Based Timeline

- **50,000+ population**: April 24, 2026
- **0-49,999 population**: April 26, 2027
- **Special district governments**: April 26, 2027

#### Population Calculation Method

- Use 2020 decennial Census data for most governments
- Use 2022 Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates for independent school districts
- Subdivisions (e.g., police departments, library branches) use the parent government's population

## Exceptions

The rule includes five specific exceptions where content does not need to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA:

### 1. Archived Web Content

Content is exempt if all four conditions are met:

- Not needed for active administrative purposes
- Not updated or otherwise modified since the compliance deadline
- Not required to be accessible by other laws or regulations
- Clearly identified as archived and available upon request

### 2. Preexisting Conventional Electronic Documents

Documents are exempt if both conditions are met:

- Created before the compliance deadline
- Not necessary for accessing current programs, services, or activities

### 3. Third-Party Posted Content

Content posted by third parties is exempt if:

- The third party is not posting due to contractual, licensing, or other arrangements with the public entity
- The entity had no editorial control over the content

### 4. Individualized Password-Protected Documents

Documents are exempt if all three conditions are met:

- Password-protected or otherwise secured
- Individualized and not available to the public
- Created before the compliance deadline

### 5. Preexisting Social Media Posts

Social media posts are exempt if:

- Posted before the compliance deadline
- Not updated after the deadline

## Implementation Guidance

### Conforming Alternate Versions

- State and local governments may provide conforming alternate versions when direct compliance is not possible
- Alternate versions must be equivalent in content and functionality
- Must be as accessible to people with disabilities as the primary version

### Minor Non-Compliance

- The rule recognizes that perfect compliance may not always be achievable
- Minor deviations that do not significantly impact accessibility may be acceptable
- Focus should be on substantial compliance and good faith efforts

## Compliance Steps

### Action Step 1: Learn the Requirements

- Review the DOJ Fact Sheet for basic understanding
- Consult the Small Entity Compliance Guide for detailed application
- Study the full rule with explanatory appendix

### Action Step 2: Determine Compliance Deadline

- Calculate population using Census data
- Identify appropriate compliance date based on population size
- Consider special district status if applicable

### Action Step 3: Assign Responsibility

- Identify ADA Coordinator or compliance lead
- Determine roles for IT, web development, and content teams
- Establish cross-departmental coordination

### Action Step 4: Train Staff

- Provide accessibility training for developers and content creators
- Educate procurement staff on accessible vendor selection
- Train support staff on accessibility accommodations

### Action Step 5: Inventory Digital Assets

- Catalog all websites and mobile applications
- Identify third-party platforms and services
- Document current accessibility status

### Action Step 6: Review Exceptions

- Evaluate content against exception criteria
- Document justification for any exemptions
- Plan remediation for non-exempt content

### Action Step 7: Prioritize Remediation

- Focus on high-traffic and essential services first
- Address critical accessibility barriers
- Create remediation timeline and budget

### Action Step 8: Update Contracts

- Review vendor agreements for accessibility requirements
- Include accessibility clauses in new contracts
- Ensure third-party services meet compliance standards

### Action Step 9: Create Policies

- Develop accessibility policy and procedures
- Establish ongoing monitoring processes
- Create accommodation request procedures

## Technical Implementation
