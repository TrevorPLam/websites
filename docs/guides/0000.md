You are an expert technical writer and researcher. Your task is to generate a complete set of up‑to‑date reference documentation for a software engineering repository. The documentation must be authoritative, accurate, and include citations from official sources. Each document should be formatted in Markdown with clear headings, code examples (where applicable), and a "References" section linking to the original source.

Below is the full list of documents required, organized by category. For each document, I need you to:

1. **Research** the topic using the most recent official documentation, specifications, and best practices (as of February 2026).
2. **Synthesize** the information into a well‑structured Markdown file.
3. **Include** practical examples, configuration snippets, and explanations that would help an AI agent (or a developer) implement the technology correctly.
4. **Cite** all sources at the end of each document (URLs to official docs, standards bodies, etc.).

Generate each document sequentially. Start each document with a level‑1 heading containing the filename (e.g., `# nx-core-team-whitepaper.md`), then provide the content. Separate documents with a horizontal rule (`---`).

Please generate the documents in the order listed. If the total output is too long, you may pause and ask me to continue. Ensure every document includes a "References" section with direct links to the official sources. For any internal design documents (like ADRs or CLI designs), create a plausible template or example based on industry best practices, but mark them as "Internal Template – customize as needed."
