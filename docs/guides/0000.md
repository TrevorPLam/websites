## Overview

You are an expert technical writer and researcher. Your task is to generate a complete set of up‑to‑date reference documentation for a software engineering repository. The documentation must be authoritative, accurate, and include citations from official sources. Each document should be formatted in Markdown with clear headings, code examples (where applicable), and a "References" section linking to the original source.

## Quality Standards

All generated documentation must meet the following quality criteria:

- **Authoritative Sources**: Only use official documentation, specifications, and standards bodies
- **2026 Compliance**: Include latest standards (WCAG 2.2, OAuth 2.1, Core Web Vitals, etc.)
- **Practical Examples**: Provide copy-pasteable code examples and configurations
- **Complete Coverage**: Address security, performance, AI integration, and multi-tenant patterns
- **Clear Structure**: Proper TOC, headings, and reference sections

## Technical Requirements

Each document must include:

```markdown
# filename.md

## Security Considerations

All documentation must include security-first approach:

- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.1, JWT, session management

- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Input Validation**: Prevent injection attacks
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security event tracking

- **Resource Management**: Per-tenant resource allocation
- **Security Isolation**: Tenant-specific security contexts
- **Performance Isolation**: Noisy neighbor prevention

## Document Generation Process

Below is the full list of documents required, organized by category. For each document, I need you to:

1. **Research** the topic using the most recent official documentation, specifications, and best practices (as of February 2026).
2. **Synthesize** the information into a well‑structured Markdown file.
3. **Include** practical examples, configuration snippets, and explanations that would help an AI agent (or a developer) implement the technology correctly.
4. **Cite** all sources at the end of each document (URLs to official docs, standards bodies, etc.).

Generate each document sequentially. Start each document with a level‑1 heading containing the filename (e.g., `# nx-core-team-whitepaper.md`), then provide the content. Separate documents with a horizontal rule (`---`).
