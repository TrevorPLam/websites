# THEPLAN — Execution Plan for NEW.md Alignment

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-19  
**Purpose:** Authoritative execution plan for aligning the repository with the "Organic Evolution" strategy in [NEW.md](../../NEW.md).  
**Related:** [THEGOAL.md](../../THEGOAL.md) (target architecture), [tasks/TASKS.md](../../tasks/TASKS.md) (task index)

---

## Summary

[NEW.md](../../NEW.md) defines a **single-track evolutionary path** ("Strangler Fig") over 26 weeks toward a capability-driven, multi-tenant platform. This plan covers: (1) documentation updates, (2) task extraction from NEW.md, (3) updating existing tasks, (4) reprioritization, and (5) implementation order.
