# Documentation Structure

This directory is organized to keep architecture, guides, plans, and operational runbooks easy to locate.

## Top-level layout

- `guides/` — domain and technology guides
- `plan/` — program/domain planning artifacts
- `standards/` — governance and policy docs
- `site/` — static docs site assets

## Authoring rules

- Use markdown (`.md`) for prose.
- Prefer one concept per document.
- Cross-link related docs and task IDs.
- Keep titles task/domain searchable.
