# THE GOAL: Becoming a Legendary Developer (0.01%)

> "The goal is not to be better than others, but to be better than you were yesterday."  
> — But for legendary developers, the goal is to make entire classes of problems impossible.

This document outlines the path from "good" to "legendary" developer. These are not quick wins—they are fundamental shifts in how you think about code, systems, and software development.

## Quick Reference

### Practices of the 0.01%

1. **Formal Methods** - TLA+, Coq, mathematical proofs
2. **Dependent Types** - Idris, Agda, impossible states impossible
3. **Effect Systems** - Track side effects in types
4. **Property-Based Testing** - Generate millions of test cases ✅ (Added)
5. **Code Generation** - Generate from specs ✅ (Added)
6. **Immutable Everything** - No mutable state
7. **Mathematical Abstractions** - Category theory, monads
8. **Zero-Cost Abstractions** - Rust, compile-time computation
9. **Build for Decades** - 10+ year horizons
10. **Create Your Own Tools** - Shape the industry

### The Mindset Shift

**From:** "How do I solve this?"  
**To:** "How do I make this impossible?"

**From:** "How do I test this?"  
**To:** "How do I prove this correct?"

**From:** "How do I fix this bug?"  
**To:** "How do I make this bug impossible?"

### Learning Path

1. **Phase 1 (6-12 months):** Functional programming, type systems, mathematics
2. **Phase 2 (1-2 years):** Formal methods, dependent types, property-based testing
3. **Phase 3 (2+ years):** Create languages, contribute to design, teach others
