# CaCA and Layer Architecture

- **site.config.ts** is the single source of truth for all client behavior. Never hardcode client-specific values in components.
- **Layers:** L0 = @repo/infra, integrations; L2 = @repo/ui, features, types, utils; L3 = clients
- **Dependencies:** clients → @repo/* only; never packages → clients; never clients → clients
- **Imports:** Use public package exports only; no deep paths like @repo/infra/src/internal
- **Validation:** Run `pnpm validate-client [path]` for client changes; `pnpm validate-exports` for package exports
