# Task Execution Non-Negotiables

Every task must satisfy all 10. Full details: [.context/RULES.md](../.context/RULES.md#task-execution-non-negotiables).

1. **THEGOAL alignment** — Read THEGOAL.md before starting; align with repo direction. For evol-* tasks, also check [evolution-roadmap](../../docs/architecture/evolution-roadmap.md) and tasks/evol-*.md
2. **Research** — 02/2026 basics, fundamentals, best practices; research if absent
3. **Examples** — Code snippets from research + current implementation
4. **Refactor tasks** — If research contradicts existing but suggests better, create follow-up tasks
5. **QA (3 passes)** — (1) isolation (2) related files (3) full codebase
6. **Testing** — Create/update/run tests + validation; incomplete without this
7. **Documentation** — Meta headers, inline commentary, repo docs; incomplete without this
8. **Additional tasks** — Determine if new tasks needed after completion
9. **Lessons learned** — Attach to related tasks/docs
10. **Commit & push** — After each task
