# Prompts as Code

Prompts are treated as versioned repository artifacts.

## Rules

- Keep prompts in markdown files under `prompts/`.
- Require code review for prompt changes.
- Include purpose, constraints, and expected output schema.
- Reference relevant policy files for high-risk use cases.

## Templates

- `prompts/templates/architecture-analysis.prompt.md`
- `prompts/architecture-patterns.prompt.md`
