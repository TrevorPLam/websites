# Marketing Monorepo LLM Context

Project: Multi-tenant, multi-site Next.js marketing monorepo.

Primary docs:
- README.md
- DESIGN.md
- CODEMAP.md
- TODO.md
- AGENTS.md

Architecture:
- Feature-Sliced Design v2.1
- Layer order: app -> pages -> widgets -> features -> entities -> shared
- Prefer package public exports (`index.ts`), avoid deep imports.

Quality and security:
- Run lint, type-check, tests, and docs validation before merge.
- Keep tenant isolation explicit.
- Never log or commit secrets.

Task tracking:
- Update TODO.md and task artifacts under tasks/ when tasks are completed.
